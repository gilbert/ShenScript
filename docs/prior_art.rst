shen-js
-------

This library is attempt to improve on the existing `shen-js <https://github.com/gravicappa/shen-js>`_ project by `Ramil Farkhshatov <https://github.com/gravicappa>`_. shen-js implements its own KLVM on top of JS, allowing it to handle deep recursion without stack overflow and make asynchronous I/O transparent to Shen code. It outputs in a large deployable (\~12MB uncompressed). ShenScript is intended to instead be a lighter-weight solution built on more recent JS features, output a smaller deployable and provide plentify facilities for web development.
